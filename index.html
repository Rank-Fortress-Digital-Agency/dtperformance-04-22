                1. Check your oil regularly and change it when necessary.
            </h2>
            <p>
                One of the most important things you can do is check your oil regularly. If you let your oil level get too low, it can damage your engine and cause extensive repairs. Be sure to change your oil when necessary, and always use high-quality oil filters to protect your engine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another important maintenance task is changing your air filter. A dirty air filter can reduce performance and fuel economy, and may even cause damage to the engine. Change your air filter at least every 12,000 miles or according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
            </p>

                4. Get your car's engine tuned up every few years.
            </h2>
            <p>
                One of the most important things you can do is get your engine tuned up every few years. This will help your car run more efficiently and save you money on gas. You should also change the oil and filter regularly, and make sure that all of the fluid levels are correct. If you neglect to do these things, your car will eventually start to show signs of wear and tear.

                2. Keep your tires inflated to the proper pressure.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Maintaining your car is important to keeping it running like new. You can do a few things to keep your car in top condition and prolong its life. One of the most important is keeping your tires inflated to the proper pressure. Underinflated tires wear out more quickly, and they can also cause problems with handling and braking. Overinflating your tires can lead to decreased fuel economy and premature wear on the tread.
            </p>
            <p>
                To find the correct inflation pressure for your vehicle, consult your owner’s manual or look up the specifications online. The recommended pressure will be listed under one of two headings: “maximum load” or “recommended cold inflation pressure.” The latter number is what you should inflate your tires too.

                3. Inspect your brakes regularly and have them replaced or serviced as needed.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Brake maintenance is one of the most important aspects of car care, but it’s also one of the most commonly neglected areas. Many people don’t think about their brakes until they start making noise or they begin to feel a pulsing sensation in the brake pedal. By that time, however, it may be too late and expensive repairs may be necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s why it’s important to inspect your brakes regularly and have them serviced as needed. If you’re not sure how to do this, there are plenty of resources available online or at your local library. Once you know what to look for, it’s simply a matter of taking the time to do the inspection.

                5. Flush your car's radiator and refill it with fresh coolant as needed.
              </h2>
              <p>
                Most people are under the impression that mechanics will only warranty their <a href="https://dtperformance.com.au/mechanical-repairs-darwin/">repairs</a> for a short amount of time. This is not always the case, as mechanics often stand by their work and offer long-term warranties to their clients. A good mechanic will want to ensure that their client is happy with the repair job they have done, and will be more than happy to offer a warranty on their work. In some cases, this warranty may even extend for the life of the car.

                6. Check your car's battery and clean the terminals as needed.
              </h2>
              <p>
                Your car’s battery is essential for starting the engine and powering electrical components. Over time, the battery terminals can become corroded, which can prevent the battery from starting the engine. Clean the terminals as needed with a wire brush or other cleaning tool.

              </h2>
              <p>
                One of the most important things you can do is lubricate your car’s door hinges, latches, and other moving parts as needed. This will help them move more smoothly and will reduce wear and tear. Another thing you can do is check the air pressure in your tires regularly and adjust it if necessary. Low tire pressure can cause excessive wear and tear on your tires, which can lead to costly repairs down the road.
